Lab05: Scheduling with FreeRTOS
<PUT NAMES HERE>

Part 1:

Q1: What is the difference between semaphore and mutex?

Q2: What FreeRTOS uses to represent a task? Compared to what you used in Lab05 
to represent a task, what features they share and what are the major differences?

Part 2:

Q3: What is the frequency of the system tick used in your code? What are the 
highest and lowest system tick frequencies to get your Lab06 to work?

Q4: There is also (obviously) a context switching implementation in FreeRTOS 
source code for Cortex-M3, find the code and list the technical differences 
from your context switching code in Lab05.
